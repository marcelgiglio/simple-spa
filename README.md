# simple-spa
a simple skeleton SPA that i made for trainning purpose

Flask was used only for serving. Preharps nginx was better.
This website has no login, or security, or any kind of content. A skeleton only.

It loads a mask with top and left navbar only. Then, it loads the page content with ajax request.
As the user request another page, it loads new content and show it on screen. But it doesn't refresh page and don't forget other pages loaded before.

This is very useful for a experience of a native app on the browser.
